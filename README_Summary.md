# Overview
[the ESCAPE(Experiments, Scenarios, Concept of Operations, and Prototype Engineering) dataset, collected at the Information Directorate's Stockbridge Site. 
The collection instruments include two SUAS (small unmanned flight system), four different observation towers, and two ground sensors. The researchers gathered 
data on four types of moving targets, a van, two gators(gas/diesel), a pickup truck, and a rack truck. The data includes information on P-RF(passive radiofrequency), 
radar, EO(electro-optical), IR (infrared), seismic and acoustic sensing. Having multimodal data provides many advantages, but the long term goal for this project is to 
create "signatures" for each of the targets. These "signatures" are formed by fusing the heterogeneous data types together to understand the unique behavior, "signature", 
for each target. To approach this pragmatically the researchers utilized a metal building in the center of the Stockbridge site, dubbed the "Butler Building". During each 
test run two or more targets would circle the site and then enter the Butler Building. Upon exiting the building the targets would leave at varying times, and some may not 
depart at all. If the researchers can successfully develop suitable signatures for each target based on the multi modal data, this allows the targets to be accurately 
identified as they exit.](#-Overview)
